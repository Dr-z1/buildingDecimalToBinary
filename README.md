Course Name: Learn Recursion By Building a Decimal to Binary Conveerter


deatils:

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. 

This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

In this project, you’ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. 

You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, 

and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.
